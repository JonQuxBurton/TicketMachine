# Ticket Machine

# Overview

The solution consists of the following projects:

## TicketMachine
This is the source code for the Ticket Machine.

To perform the search for matching stations, I have implemented two algorithms which are in the folders BasicStrategy and TreeBasedStrategy.
BasicStrategy is a simple implementation using LINQ, which is used as a baseline for the performance comparison tests. TreeBased Strategy is an implementation using a tree for faster retrieval time at the cost slower start up time (as the tree gets created).

The data for the stations is loaded by the code in the Data folder.

## TicketMachine.ConsoleApp
This is console app to interactively test the Ticket Machine. 

It can be run with the following command:
`dotnet run -c Release`

(from a Powershell/command prompt and from the folder \TicketMachine\TicketMachine.ConsoleApp\)

It can also run a performance test where a large number of GetSuggestion() calls are performed and the total execution time returned. This is done for the both Basic and TreeBased strategies. The command for this test is:
`dotnet run -c Release perf`

It can also be run with the Basic strategy (instead of the default TreeBased strategy) using the following command:
`dotnet run -c Release basic`

## TicketMachine.Tests
These are the tests for the TicketMachine.

# Performance Comparisons

## Execution Time

Running the performance tests gave me the following result (in seconds):

|Run #  |Basic Strategy |TreeBased Strategy |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
|1		  |16.9			      |0.020              |
|2		  |17.3 			    |0.028              |
|3		  |18.8 			    |0.035              |
|Average|17.7			      |0.028              |

So the TreeBased Strategy is considerably faster (approximately ~600 times faster).

## Memory

Using the dotMemory profiler, and performing search with the letters 'DART' gave the following results:

Basic		.NET Total: 321 KB
TreeBased	.NET Total: 8.74 MB

So the TreeBased Strategy uses much more memory however it is still only a small amount.
